dependencies: moonlib, cyclone, zexy, iemguts, iemlib  

## Installation Instructions

1. clone this repository or click "download as zip". 
2. Extract the folders adlib and eclobjects and add them to your pd path by opening pd, and going to Pd -> Preferences -> Path. Click "new" and navigate to wherever adlib and eclobjects are stored.
3. Install dependencies if you don't have them already: Click Help -> Find Externals to open the Deken plugin manager and search for the libraries listed above. Find the appropriate version and install.
